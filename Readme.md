Manhattan distance kata

Manhattan distance is the distance between two points in a grid 
(like the grid-like street geography of the New York borough of Manhattan) 
calculated by only taking a vertical and/or horizontal path.

Complete the function that accepts two points and returns 
the Manhattan Distance between the two points.

The points are arrays or tuples containing the x and y coordinate in the grid. 
You can think of x as the row in the grid, and y as the column.

Write a function int manhattanDistance(Point, Point) 
that returns the Manhattan Distance between the two points.

Rules:

+The class Point is immutable (its state cannot be changed after instantiation)

+The class Point has no Getters

+The class Point has no public properties (i.e. the internal state cannot be read from outside the class).
